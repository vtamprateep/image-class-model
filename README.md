# Landscape Vision Model

This is a Neural Network Image Classification model deployed on a flask app. The neural network was trained on ~14,000 images to detect 6 types of landscapes:

1. Building
2. Forest
3. Glacier
4. Mountain
5. Sea
6. Street

The dataset used was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) and preprocessed using a custom script into a CSV file.
